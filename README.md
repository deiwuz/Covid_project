# COVID-19 ETL Pipeline

A robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline designed to analyze COVID-19 infection rates normalized by population. This project processes raw COVID-19 case data and population statistics to produce meaningful insights and publication-quality visualizations.

## 📋 Features

- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Validates and previews input datasets before processing.
- **Intelligent Merging**: Automatically standardizes country names to ensure accurate data integration across different sources.
- **Per Capita Analysis**: Calculates cases per 100,000 inhabitants to allow fair comparisons between countries of varying sizes.
- **Visualization**: Generates clear, colorblind-friendly horizontal bar charts of the top affected countries.
- **Dockerized**: Fully containerized for consistent execution across different environments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.14+** (if running locally)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized execution)

### 📦 Installation

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

Run the entire pipeline in an isolated container without installing dependencies locally.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deiwuz/Covid_project
    cd Covid_project
    ```

2.  **Run with Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

#### Option 2: Local Installation

Using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (fast Python package installer) or standard pip.

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Using pip
    pip install .

    # Using uv
    uv pip install . --system
    ```

2.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 🛠️ Usage

The pipeline runs interactively by default. Follow the on-screen prompts to:

1.  **Select Data**: Choose your Population and COVID-19 CSV files from the `data/` directory.
2.  **Standardize**: If country columns are not automatically detected, you will be asked to identify them.
3.  **Process**: The pipeline will automatically merge data, calculate statistics, and generate plots.

### Automated Mode

You can also run the pipeline non-interactively by passing file paths as arguments:

```bash
python main.py <Username> <folder_path_population> <folder_path_covid>
```
*Note: Ensure the paths point to the specific CSV files if the script supports it, or rely on the interactive mode for precise selection.*

## 📊 Outputs

The pipeline generates the following artifacts:

1.  **`data/merged_covid_population.csv`**: A clean dataset combining COVID-19 cases with population data.
2.  **`data/covid_cases_per_100k.csv`**: A ranked list of countries by infection rate, useful for further analysis.
3.  **`plots/covid_cases_per_100k_barplot.png`**: A high-resolution bar chart showing the top countries with the highest cases per capita.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Pandas**: For high-performance data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static data visualization.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
